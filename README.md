# 🔥 Wildfire Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Title
**Prediction of High-Risk Areas and Seasons for Wildfires for Prevention**

## 🌍 Overview
This project aims to predict when and where wildfires are most likely to occur using climate data such as humidity, wind speed, temperature, and rainfall. Our goal is to reduce the impact of wildfires through early prediction and timely response.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict wildfire risks (Low, Medium, High) by region and month
- Identify key environmental variables influencing wildfire risk
- Provide actionable insights for forest and firefighting agencies

## 🧪 Dataset
- **Source**: [The Weather Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Variables used: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Rainfall
- Aggregated to monthly level for modeling

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data cleaning and monthly aggregation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multi-class classification using **Random Forest**
- Evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

## 🗃️ Target Variable
- Wildfire Risk: `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`

## 📈 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## 🌱 Stakeholders
- Forest Management Agencies  
- Meteorological Institutions  
- Firefighting Departments  
- Environmental NGOs

## 📌 Outcomes
- Trained model for wildfire risk prediction
- Interactive visualizations and performance metrics
- Recommendations for future deployment
